"SPIDEY TO THE HELP"


The main motive behind this idea as the name suggests is to create a virtual connection between the victim of natural disater and the rescue teams nearby yhe victim.
This idea basically focuses on the principle of "CALL AND REPORT". 
This idea is a very effective and individual oriented to protect each and every single one of the victim affected by the natural disasters.

SUPPOSE:

A person or a group of people are trapped in a situation where there is no physical assistance available to them. 
One might have seen the rescue teams hovering around the affected areas in search of victims blindly without the knowledge of their location.

OUR IDEA:

A person trapped in the disaster generates a signal which is caught up by the rescue teams.
The nearest rescue team reports on a public portal and other teams makes sure that the victim receives an aid from that particular team.
Once a victim is helped or saved, the report on the portal is updated and the portal reports: "RESCUED" . 
If not then the next nearest team has to report on the portal as soon as possible.
The main objective of this idea is to provide aid  at individual level rather than the rescue teams searching for the victims.
The affected victims generates a signal to make the task of rescue teams more easier, effective and efficient.


The BEST part about our idea "SPIDEY TO THE HELP" is that despite of the tower loss during the disasters, the use of radio waves, sattelites and  GPS makes it more efficient and accurate.

THANK YOU.
